# PocketBase Go SDK Guide

Our backend application is built using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/). We're using the posability to use pocketbase as a framework and therefore wrote our own main.go and go modules.

## E-Mail Templates  

All e-mail templates are located in the `templates` folder. The templates are written in [Go HTML Template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) format. The templates are located right by the module that uses them. 

## Setup

This guide explains how to use [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) with Go to build a backend application.

## Prerequisites

* Go installed (version 1.18 or later)
* PocketBase binary downloaded from [PocketBase releases](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases)
* Basic knowledge of Go programming

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up PocketBase

1. Download the PocketBase binary for your platform.
2. Run the PocketBase server:
    

```bash
    ./pocketbase serve
    ```

3. Access the admin dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/` and configure your database.

### 2. Install PocketBase Go SDK

Add the PocketBase Go SDK to your project:

```bash
go get github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase
```

### 3. Initialize PocketBase in Your Go Project

Create a new Go file (e.g., `main.go` ) and initialize PocketBase:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
)

func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()

    // Add custom routes or hooks if needed
    app.OnBeforeServe().Add(func(e *pocketbase.ServeEvent) error {
        log.Println("PocketBase server is starting...")
        return nil
    })

    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

### 4. Run Your Go Application

Run your Go application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Your PocketBase server will now be running, and you can interact with it programmatically.

### 5. Interact with PocketBase API

Use the PocketBase Go SDK to interact with the database. For example, to create a new record:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/models"
)

func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()

    app.OnBeforeServe().Add(func(e *pocketbase.ServeEvent) error {
        collection := app.Dao().FindCollectionByNameOrId("example_collection")
        record := models.NewRecord(collection)
        record.Set("field_name", "value")

        if err := app.Dao().SaveRecord(record); err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }

        log.Println("Record created successfully!")
        return nil
    })

    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```
